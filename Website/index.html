            <h2>Republic Act 7877</h2>
            <p>
                Also known as <strong>Anti-Sexual Haraddment Act of 1995</strong>. This law prohobits sexual harassment in places like educational institutions, workplace and training environments. This aims to protect people from unwanted sexual advances and other forms of sexual misconduct.

            <ul>
                This is a structured approach that addresses various aspects of a womans life, empowerment and development.

                <li>Human rights</li>

            <p><strong>Civil Society (UKP-network for women in politics)</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <p>Also known as <strong>"Ugnayan ng mga Kababaihan na Pulitika"</strong>. The goal is to support candidates, both male and female who advocatefor women's rights and empowerment. The agenda includes pressing issues like upholding international humanitarian law, penalizing sexual harassment, ect.</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case Scenario</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>In "male dominant" fields, women are often seen as more less than them, some men might even go down the drain and force sexual action towards women in the same workplace. Then proceeds to silence them using threats.</p>
                <p>With the help of a friend, the woman saves up the courage to report him to the authorities and he shall be punished accordingly.</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Call to Action</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <p>
                    To catch up with today's level in technology, we can spread word about these situation rather fast. And with how many people are on these apps, they will continue to share word and soon make a move to make advocates, protests and petitions.
                </p>
                <p> Given that the time we live in speaks more about a womans rights and gender 
                    equality, we can very much voice out anything anywhere and to anyone. 
                </p>
